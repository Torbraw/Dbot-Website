Dbot is a simple RPG with monsters, loots, quests, PVP, ranking and even more. All of that available in Discord via a bot.
Like any other RPG, your goal is to level up and become the strongest player with the best equipment.  

## How to play

First, you need to invite the bot to your server, or join the [official server](https://discord.gg/BQbVNJfwvj) to be able to use the commands.
Afterwards, you can start playing by using any slash commands of the bot. If you don't know what slash commands are, you can read about them [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ). One of the main commands you can do to start is `/slot` which is the basic command to aquire items.  
You can also use the `/help` command to get a list of all available commands and if you want even more details about them, you can even read the [documentation](/en/documentation/commands/slot) for all of them.
