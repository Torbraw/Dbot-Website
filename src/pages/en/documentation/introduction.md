Dbot is a simple RPG with monsters, loots, quests, PVP, ranking and even more. All of that available in Discord via a bot.
Like any other RPG, your goal is to level up and become the strongest player with the best equipment.  
  
To be able to play with the bot, you need to [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=804548465878237215&scope=applications.commands%20bot&permissions=1428345547856) the bot to your server, or join the [discord community  server](https://discord.gg/BQbVNJfwvj) to be able to use the commands.
Afterwards, you can start playing by using any slash commands of the bot. If you don't know what slash commands are, you can read about them [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ). One of the main command you can do is `/slot` which is the basic command to aquire items.
If you want to have more details about the commands, you can read the [documentation](/en/documentation/commands/slot) for all of them.

## Community Discord

The community discord is the place where you can talk with other players, ask for help, report bug or even give ideas for new features. This is also the place where you can see the changelog to know what has been added or changed in the bot.
