Items are the core of the game. They are used to boost your stats and give you a better chance of winning battles. They are four rarities of items: common <img src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/Common.png'>, rare <img src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/Rare.png'>, epic <img src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/Epic.png'> and legendary <img src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/Legendary.png'>. The higher the rarity, the better the item is but also the harder it is to get.  
You can see the items you have with the `/inventory` command and you can equip them with the `/equip-unequip` command.

You can sell items for a fixed price with the `/sell-item` or `/sell-items` command. Those commands will never sells items in your inventory. You can also sell items to other players on the marketplace with a price of your choice with the `/marketplace-action` command.

## Difference between marketplace and dbot-marketplace

The `/dbot-marketplace` is a marketplace where you can buy items (and spells) from the bot directly. The `/marketplace` is a place where you can buy and sells items with other players. The marketplace is not restricted to each server, it is a global marketplace.

## Related commands

- You can gift an item to another player with the `/gift-item` command.
- To have info about a certain item, you can use the `/get-info` command or visit the [encyclopedia](/en/encyclopedia/items).
