Each discord account is linked to a player account, that means that your progress is saved between different discord servers and you can play on multiple servers.
On the other hand, you need to make sur you are always playing on the same discord account.
  
The player has three stats: attack, mana and health. You start your adventure with 20 attack, 50 mana and 100 health.
Attack and mana is used to attack monsters or other players and health is used to defend yourself when facing enemies or players.
Players can also have [items](/en/documentation/features/items), that is used to increase their stats.

In your journey, you will acquire achievements and sometimes titles linked to your achievements.
You can equip a title to show it to other players with the `/set-title` command.

To see your achievements, your stats and more, you can use the `/profile` command.
Of course, you can also see other players profiles with the same command, to see who is better.
If you think your are the best player their is, you can see the top players accross all server by using the `/rank` command.
