You can embark on quests to earn rewards with the `/quest`. They are multiple types of quests, each with their own gameplay. Like a lot of things in the game, they are four rarity levels, the higher the rarity, the more difficult the quest is but also the more rewards you get.

When you complete a quest, you earn **quest ressources** of the rarity of the quest. You can see which quest ressources you have with the `/inventory` command. You can use these ressources to craft items of the same rarity with the `/craft` command. You can also use the rare quest ressources to craft spells with the same command.
