Monsters are randomly spawned **only** in the pve channel, read the [servers docs](/en/documentation/features/servers) to know how to set it up. They are four rarity levels. The higher the rarity, the more health it has and the lower the chance of spawning is.

When you see a monster, you can attack it with the `/attack` command. The damage you deal is based on your attack stat. You can attack a monster multiple times, but there is a cooldown between each attack. When a monster dies, everyone who attacked it has a chance to get an item. If you attacked it multiples times, you don't have higher chances of getting an item. The item you get is based on the rarity of the monster.
