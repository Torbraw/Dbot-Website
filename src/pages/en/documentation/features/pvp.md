You can challenge other players in a pvp battle **only** in the pvp channel, read the [servers docs](/en/documentation/features/servers) to know how to set it up. The battle is a turn based system and the first to reach 0 health loses.

## Types of actions

- **Attack**: You attack the other player and deal damage based on your attack stat. There is 3 type of attacks: light, normal and heavy. Each type of attack has a different percentage of hitting and a different damage multiplier.  
- **Cast a spell**: You use one of the [spells](/en/documentation/features/spells) you have equipped if you have enough mana to do so.
