You can enchant your items using enchant gems <img src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/EnchantGems.png'> with the `/enchant` command.

The higher your item rarity is, the more enchant gems you will need to enchant it and the lower the chance of success will be.

If you succeed, you will either get a one star or two star enchantment, represented by * or ** at the end of the item name. The difference between the two is that the two star enchantment have a slightly higher stat boost, but the main stat gain is a non enchanted item to an enchanted one.
