You can embark on quests to earn rewards with the `/quest` command. They are multiple types of quests, each with their own gameplay. Like a lot of things in the game, they are four rarity levels, the higher the rarity, the more difficult the quest is but the better rewards you get.

## Quests ressources

When you complete a quest, you earn **quest ressources** of the rarity of the quest. You can see which quest ressources you have with the `/inventory` command. You can use these ressources to craft items of the same rarity with the `/craft` command. You can also use the rare quest ressources to craft spells with the same command.

To see the lists of quest ressources, you can visit the [encyclopedia](/en/encyclopedia/quest-ressources).
