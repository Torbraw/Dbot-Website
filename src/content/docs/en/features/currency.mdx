They are three types of currency in the game: coins <Image width="24" height="24" alt="coins" src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/Coins.png' />,
blood coins <Image width="24" height="24" alt="blood-coins" src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/BloodCoins.png' />
and enchant gems <Image width="24" height="24" alt="enchant-gems" src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/EnchantGems.png' />.
Each of them can be obtained in different ways and are used for different purposes. If you have too much of one currency, you can exchange it for another one using the `/trade-currency` command. Since some currencies are more valuable than others, they are different rates for each exchange.

You can see your current amount of each currency in your profile using the `/profile` command.

## Coins <Image width="24" height="24" alt="coins" src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/Coins.png' />

Coins is the main currency of the game. It is obtained by killing monsters, killing players, winning at the slot machine and selling items. You can spend those coins by buying items or spells at the Dbot marketplace or extra slot spins with `/buy-slot-spins`.

## Blood Coins <Image width="24" height="24" alt="blood-coins" src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/BloodCoins.png' />

Blood coins are obtained **only** by killing players. They can be used to buy **better** items at the Dbot marketplace or to buy a augmented drop percentage chance for the slot machine with `/buy-augmented-drop`.

## Enchant gems <Image width="24" height="24" alt="enchant-gems" src='https://d2lqwktucnc67y.cloudfront.net/icons/EnchantGems.png' />

Enchant gems are obtained by killing monsters, killing players and winning at the slot machine. They are used to enchant items. You can read more about that [here](/en/docs/features/enchantments).
