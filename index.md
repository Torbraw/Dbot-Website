## General concept of the game
The purpose of the game is to get the best items possible and get to the top of the rankings.

### Players
Your player has 2 statistics: attack and health. You start your journey with 20 attack and 100 health.
Attack is used for attacking monster.
Health is not used at the moment.

### Items
How to get items:
- Play the slot machine every 2 hours
- Drop an item from a monster you attacked
- Buy from the marketplace.
When you got some items, you can equip those to boost your statistics.

### Currencies
You obtains coins every time you win at slot and when attacking a monster. You can also sell items to obtain some.

### Monsters
Monsters spawns randomly in the dedicated pve channel. You can attack a monster only one time and when he dies, each person who hit it has a chance to loot an item.

### Fonctionnalités futures
Voici les prochaines fonctionnalités sur lesquelles je prévois de travailler (non définitives) :
- Enchantements d'objets
- Marché où le joueur peut vendre ses items
- Classements
- PVP
- Ajout de Mana avec certains sorts

#### Disclaimer
The bot is currently in Alpha, meaning everything can be wiped out & changed. New features will slowly rolls out. You are more than welcome to give me some feedback.
